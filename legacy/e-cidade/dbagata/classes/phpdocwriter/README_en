DOCUMENT CONVERSION

Configuration instructions:

This export function uses the Python-UNO bridge included with OpenOffice distribution and installed by
default from version OpenOffice1.1RC3 though I recommend to install the last one (v1.1.1). You don't need
to worry about python installation because OpenOffice.org comes with python 2.2.2 runtime.

This method follow the client-server architecture, you need at least one OpenOffice installation
(working as client and server) or one installation working as client (the machine where phpdocwriter runs)
and other installation working as server (the machine that converts documents).
Note: For this version of classes, client and server needs to be the same machine.

At the server side you need to do this:

	Close all OpenOffice instances (even the quickstarter).

	To make the office listen only for one session execute from shell:
	
	<OfficePath>\soffice "-accept=socket,host=localhost,port=2002;urp;"
	
	To make the office listen whenever it is started, open the file
	<OfficePath>/share/registry/data/org/openoffice/Setup.xcu in an editor, and look for the element
	<node oor:name="Office"/>.
	This element contains <prop/> elements. Insert the following <prop/> element on the same level as
	the existing elements:
	
	<prop oor:name="ooSetupConnectionURL" oor:type="xs:string">
	 <value>socket,host=localhost,port=2002;urp;</value>
	</prop>
	
	This setting configures OpenOffice.org to provide a socket on port 2002, where it will serve connections
	through the UNO remote protocol (urp).
  
	Note on Linux machines:

		OpenOffice.org application need a X session to run. If you are a console user, you need to create a new one.
		
			from console use "nohup /usr/X11R6/bin/Xvfb :25 -screen scrn 800x600x32 &" to start a new session
			
			Don't forget to export display:
				DISPLAY=":25" <OfficePath>\soffice "-accept=socket,host=localhost,port=2002;urp;"

			Use "/usr/bin/killall Xvfb" to kill the session 
				
At the client side you only need to configure the parameters at conf/config.php. Don't forget to configure also the export script file ("export.bat" for windows, "export.sh" for linux), you have to fill in two paths, OpenOffice.org pyhton executable path and python script file path.

Note: For LaTeX, XHTML 1.0 and XHTML 1.1 + MathML conversion you need to download and install the export filters from
writer2Latex project (http://www.hj-gym.dk/~hj/writer2latex/). To install these filters follow the instructions from their web site.
